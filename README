Quicksorts for C
----------------

* Unstable quicksorts with O(1) temporary storage requirement

  -- Configurable quicksorts, inlined via C macros.

  -- Plug-in replacements for qsort and (GNU-style) qsort_r.

* Stable quicksorts with O(n) temporary storage requirement

  -- Stable quicksorts are still a work in progress.


Random pivot selection is implemented with a built-in linear
congruential generator, and is fast. Middle-element and
median-of-three also are implemented.

Small subarrays can be sorted either with an enhanced binary insertion
sort or with a Shell sort.

It is possible to implement oneâ€™s own pivot selection and
small-subarray sort implementations.
